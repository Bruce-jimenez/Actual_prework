  <p>Thoughts from me: Sometimes my mind goes blank, while at the same time feeling active while having multiple thoughts. Some see this as someone who can not keep up with the day to day work. However I see as something different as the time passes by. I see it as trying to maximize every second to improve on the past self that just came by.</p>
